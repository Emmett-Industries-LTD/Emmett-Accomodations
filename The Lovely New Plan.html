            The Plan primary goal:
            <li>create an organized plan to follow and be productive</li>
            <li>homework is top priority</li>
        </h1>
        <h1>New version from sept 18:</h1>
        <h1><li>New very helpful task layout completely changes the old calendar-style plan. </li>
        <li>it makes following the plan much easier</li>
        </h1> 
        <h1>Tips for the plan</h1>
        <h1>
            <li>
            don't be afraid to make tasks very long and detailed, or add small tasks such as "eggs for breakfast"</li>
            <li>
            <li>put tasks in order of importance or what I will do first</li>    
            <li>put finished plans in order of completion</li>
            </li>
        </h1>
        <h1>What to do after work is done: </h1>
        <h1>
            <li>video games limited, mostly for the weekends.</li>
            <li>Do not worry too much about skills or khan academy, but it sould be on tasks</li>
            <li>Reading is important.</li>
            <li>If doing skill or khan academy, log it in the log below. It will really help</li>
            <li>Put games or skills as tasks if I feel like doing it.</li>

            progress log:
            <li>On Thursday sept 17 first day of the log, doing homework first, then trombone, a bit of reading</li>
            <li>Fri: I finished version 2.2.1 of the plan, which is <i>completely</i> different from the old calendar-style.
            there is now just tasks and no time you are supposed to do it. I think this new plan is great. It will be so much easier.
            There might be some later update, but for now this is great!
            This update counts as coding on the new plan. It took a while and I went on a great jazz adventure, so there was no time for reading.
            I also did journal.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sat: did baseball, hangout with mommy, did math homework, I now have the mathbook that I needed, did design homework, have to do 
                I&S homework. I did trombone, then had movie.
            </li>
            <li>Sun: big breakfast today, Yi yi and ni ni couldn't come for lunch! I did I&s homework, there was tromone lesson</li>
            <li>Monday sep 21: I went out and practiced pitching, then washed the cup and then read.</li>
            <li>wed: went to audition, then went to tryout, and then read when I got home.</li>
