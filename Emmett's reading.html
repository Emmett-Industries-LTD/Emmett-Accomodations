            I will practice with 45-50 lpm as my "home base" for practicing reading for now. <br>
            I have the freedom train book now. <br>

    <h1><u>reading goal:</u> 
        My reading rate goal is 80 lines per minute in the Book of Answers format.
        It was originally a 64 then 70 lpm goal, but it should be more because I can read faster.
        Original speed was 32 lpm. Use the BYU online free course to help reading speed. 
        Read from the Book of answers. 80 lines is about two pages in one minute </h1>

        speed reading notes:
        <li>Use the Timer at the bottom of this page for timed reading two minutes</li>
        <li>it is important to have good posture and a comfortable reading environment for reading so you can be more alert
        not to comfortable you fall asleep.</li>
       <li>finger tracking helps you read faster and stay on track without distractions</li> 
        <li>finger reading is very important and the key to finger reading</li>
        <li>
            Touch the page continually. Do not lift your finger when you 
            come to the end of the line. At the end of the line, drop your 
            finger two lines, circle back, then raise one line to read the next line 
            of text.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preview the text, which is very important so you can understand the words. 
            It will probably help if I read the book of answers or bizzare Truths with 
            previewing, because some articles can be a bit confusing.
        </li>
        <li>vocabulary is another important part of speed reading comprehension. It will come over time</li>
        Some Site info:
        <li>
            To log in is a confusing procedure. Go to <a href="https://cereg.byu.edu/o3/user/registration/current">the course</a>
            Click the log in button. It will go to another page, and then enter the password.
            it will go to the "enrolement Overveiw" page with a list of the confirmation number,
            registration date, and all this data. Click "access your cource". The browser 
            will block the popup window, which doesn't do anything anyway. Click "close" in the top left corner,
            and a new button "login" will appear. Click "login" and wait a few seconds and you will be
            brought to the "student app" page,click on speed reading course, and you will get to speed reading

            I read from the book of bizzare Truths. It is kinda like a newspaper with articles and I read

        <li>
            sept 3 yesterday I got freedom train in the mail and mom bought it. Today I got distracted and I was planning 
            to read a bit from the book of bizzare Truths, and hucleberry finn until 10:20. There was a new video game update,
            and I continued later at 10:35. Doing lesson 4.3. I am instructed to use the metronome to help scanning,
            and this is the first time I am instructed to read the freedom train book. I read first 33 pages with metronome
            method. First I did my original rate, then a bit more, then a bit more, and then read a bit faster than my original rate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Friday trying reading with metronome, on the Life And Death Of Great American Cities, and also read huckleberry finn. 
            Same reading acrivity as yesterday.
            I will practice with 45-50 lpm as my "home base" for practicing reading for now.
