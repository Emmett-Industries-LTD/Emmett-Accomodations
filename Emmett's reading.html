        speed reading notes:
        <li>it is important to have good posture and a comfortable reading environment for reading so you can be more alert
        not to comfortable you fall asleep.</li>
       <li>finger tracking helps you read faster and stay on track without distractions</li> 
        <li>finger reading is very important and the key to finger reading</li>
        <li>
            Touch the page continually. Do not lift your finger when you 
            come to the end of the line. At the end of the line, drop your 
            finger two lines, circle back, then raise one line to read the next line 
            of text.

            sunday: practicing finger reading. I got distracted and there is not much 
            time I have left to do finger reading. 3 more days. 40 lpm including some title lines with two or three words.
